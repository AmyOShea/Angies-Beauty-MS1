# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the prices of products without having to search through various pages. 
* As a user, I want to be able to access information about the various beauty treatments available to me. 
* As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask about specific treatments and understand if they are appropriate for me. 
* As a user, I want to be able to be able to find the business location. 
## Design
### Colour Scheme
I wanted to stick to a muted colour palette for this site, utilizing the white anture of non-styled pages. 
### Typography
* 'Gudea' is the font used for the body of the site with san serif used a fallback. This font is simple and easy to read while adding a modern quality.
* 'Allura' is the font used for the business name in the header and footer of the site with script used a fallback. This font is elegent when used sparingly through the site. 
### Imagery
Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in. 
* The welcome area image is used to convey a feeling rather than be informative.
* The treatments specific images are used to show either the products/equipment used, or the treamtnet in action. 
* The logo in the hearer is used to build the business brand, a simple icon that can be used across multipl platforms.
### Overall Feel
The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic while still providing the user with all of the information that may need.  
At no point do I want the user to feel 'boxed-in' by too many elements on screen.
## Wireframes
All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.

# Testing
## Validating
At the completion or heavy editing or sections, I used the following websites to check my code for syntax errors:
*  HTML - https://validator.w3.org/
*  CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
## Testing User Stories from (UX) Section
* _As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look_.
  * The welcome area on the hompage looks good on all devices. This is the main introduction to the brand and sets a nice tone for the business brand.
* _As a user, I want to be able to see the prices of products without having to search through various pages._
  * The price list is clear and visable on the home page. 

* _As a user, I want to be able to access information about the various beauty treatments available to me._
  * Treatments have their own page, laid out in cards to allow the user to browse through. 'Read More' option is available and opens a modal with further information. 
* _As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask about specific treatments and understand if they are appropriate for me._
  * The contact form allows the user to select which treatment they  are interested and sent a message to salon with their question. 
  * Clicking the phone number on the contact page will open the dial app on a mobile to allow the cutomer to call for instant contact with the salon.
  * Social link on the footer onall pages will allow the user to PM or DM the business through social media. 
* _As a user, I want to be able to be able to find the business location._ 
  * The map is clearly displayed on all devices. By clicking 'view larger map' the location will upen up in Google Maps (if app is installed on their device).
## Further Testing
### Personal Testing
Through devices that I have at home/readily available to me, I was able to continuously test on:
* Phone
  * Samsung - 
  * Huawei Y7 - Google Chrome
  * iPhone 6 - Safari
* Tablet
  * iPad Mini 7.9" - Safari
  * iPad 9.7"- Safari

### Third-Party Testing
One of the most helpful ways for me to test through out his projects was to have a few different people test the site on various devices. I choose a slect group based on their various ages/backgrounds to be able to recieve well-rounded feedback.
  * While I would generally like to include male perpective ito a test group, the business is currently targeted predominantly towards women.
