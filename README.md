# Angie's Beauty website
# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the prices of products without having to search through various pages. 
* As a user, I want to be able to access information about the various beauty treatments available to me. 
* As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask about specific treatments and understand if they are appropriate for me. 
## Design
### Colour Scheme
* I wanted to stick to a muted colour palette for this site, utilizing the white anture of non-styled pages. 
### Typography
* 'Gudea' is the font used for the body of the site with san serif used a fallback. This font is simple and easy to read while adding a modern quality.

### Imagery
* Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in. The welcome area image is more

### Overall Feel
* The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic while still providing the user with all of the information that may need.  
At no point do I want the user to feel 'boxed-in' by too many elements on screen.
