# Angie's Beauty website

Angie's Beauty is a business that specialises in beauty treatments for both face and body. A newly created business. 

You can find the live site [here](#).
# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the prices of products without having to search through various pages. 
* As a user, I want to be able to access information about the various beauty treatments available to me. 
* As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask about specific treatments and understand if they are appropriate for me. 
## Design
### Colour Scheme
I wanted to stick to a muted colour palette for this site, utilizing the white anture of non-styled pages. 
### Typography
* 'Gudea' is the font used for the body of the site with san serif used a fallback. This font is simple and easy to read while adding a modern quality.
* 'Allura' is the font used for the business name in the header and footer of the site with script used a fallback. This font is elegent when used sparingly through the site. 

### Imagery
Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in. 
* The welcome area image is used to convey a feeling rather than be informative.
* The treatments specific images are used to show either the products/equipment used, or the treamtnet in action. 
* The logo in the hearer is used to build the business brand, a simple icon that can be used across multipl platforms.
### Overall Feel
The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic while still providing the user with all of the information that may need.  
At no point do I want the user to feel 'boxed-in' by too many elements on screen.
## Wireframes
All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.

### Objective testing
One of the most helpful ways for me to test through out his projects was to have a few different people test the site on various devices. I choose a slect group based on their various ages/backgrounds to be able to recieve well-rounded feedback.
  * While I would generally like to include male perpective ito a test group, the business is currently targeted predominantly towards women.
